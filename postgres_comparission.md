h2. Deep Dive: Databricks Lakebase vs. Snowflake Postgres vs. AWS Aurora Postgres as Low-Latency Data Stores

h3. 1. What Are These Postgres-Compatible Offerings?

* *Databricks Lakebase (Postgres-Compatible)*
** Announced at Data+AI Summit 2024, Databricks Lakehouse now supports a fully Postgres-compatible endpoint ("Lakebase") on top of its Delta Lake storage.
** Lets you query lakehouse data with the Postgres wire protocol and SQL syntax.
** Data remains in Delta Lake; Databricks provides a Postgres protocol server translating SQL to optimized lakehouse queries.
** Goal: Seamless integration for operational analytics; lower cost than maintaining OLTP DB.

* *Snowflake Postgres*
** PostgreSQL-compatible endpoint for Snowflake, announced in 2024.
** Provides Postgres wire protocol, enabling BI tools, legacy apps, and microservices to use Snowflake as if it's Postgres.
** Internally translates Postgres protocol queries to Snowflake SQL and executes on its columnar storage.

* *Aurora Postgres (AWS)*
** Cloud-native, fully managed, highly compatible Postgres database.
** Runs real Postgres code, with managed high availability, multi-AZ replication, and fast failover.
** Aurora separates compute/storage, up to 15 read replicas, supports cross-region/global deployments.
** Goal: Fully-featured OLTP and analytics platform for apps, reporting, and analytic workloads.

h3. 3. Suitability as a Low-Latency Consumption Layer

* *Databricks Lakebase*
** Strengths: Postgres endpoint for apps/BI, operational analytics, ML feature serving. Query pushdown, serverless scaling. Best for analytics, dashboards, not high-frequency OLTP.
** Caveats: Lower per-row throughput and higher latency for OLTP. ACID semantics match Delta Lake, not all Postgres nuances.

* *Snowflake Postgres*
** Strengths: Same as Lakebase – operational analytics, BI, app integration. Strong concurrency and fast dashboard/app access.
** Caveats: Not built for high-throughput single-row OLTP; optimal for analytics, dashboards, feature serving.

* *Aurora Postgres*
** Strengths: True OLTP performance, transactional, concurrent, low-latency row-level reads/writes. Great for microservices, mobile, dashboards. Massive read scaling, high write throughput (single writer).
** Caveats: Billed per usage, potentially expensive for massive, infrequent workloads. Data must be loaded into Aurora, not direct lake/warehouse access.

h3. 4. Practical Architecture Patterns

|| Pattern || Lakebase / Snowflake Postgres || Aurora Postgres ||
| Direct Lake Query by Apps | Yes (Postgres protocol on lake) | No (needs data imported) |
| Real-time Operational Dashboards | Yes (for derived, batch, streaming data) | Yes (for transactional/row-level data) |
| Transactional Workloads (OLTP) | Not primary use case | Yes, ideal |
| ML Feature Serving | Yes, fast on fresh/curated data | Yes, but needs ETL/loading |
| Ad-hoc Analytics | Yes | Possible, not optimal |
| Row-level Locking/ACID Transactions | Partial (Delta Lake/Snowflake semantics) | Full Postgres ACID |

----

h3. 5. Recommendations and Takeaways

* Use Lakebase/Snowflake Postgres for Postgres compatibility on your lake/warehouse for analytics, dashboards, app features (not write-heavy OLTP).
* Use Aurora Postgres for full transactional OLTP performance and microsecond-millisecond reads/writes and relational features.
* Hybrid: Use Lakebase/Snowflake Postgres for analytics/serving, Aurora Postgres for transactional/operational systems.

h2. Understanding the Postgres Wire Protocol and Emulator Approach in Databricks Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres

h3. 1. What Does "Postgres Wire Protocol" Mean?

* The Postgres wire protocol is the low-level, binary network protocol used by PostgreSQL clients (like psql, DBeaver, or BI tools) to communicate with a Postgres server.
* Supporting this protocol means any standard Postgres client can connect “as if” it’s talking to a real Postgres database.

----

h3. 2. What’s Really Happening in Databricks Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres?

* Both platforms provide a proxy server that speaks the Postgres wire protocol.
* When a client connects (Tableau, DBT, psycopg2, etc.), it believes it’s talking to a real Postgres backend.
* Under the hood, these are *not* running a full Postgres engine.

----

h4. A. Protocol Emulation Layer

* Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres offer a “proxy” that speaks the Postgres wire protocol.
* The client (BI tool, app, etc.) connects and sends SQL just like with a native Postgres DB.
* However, the backend is not Postgres—it’s a translation/emulation layer.

----

h4. B. Query Translation/Adaptation

* The Postgres-compatible endpoint parses incoming Postgres SQL and translates it into the native query language of the underlying platform:

**Databricks Lakebase:**
    * Postgres SQL → Delta Lake SQL / Databricks SQL
    * Queries are re-mapped for execution on Delta Lake tables and the Databricks engine.

**Snowflake Postgres:**
    * Postgres SQL → Snowflake SQL
    * Queries are rewritten to Snowflake’s internal SQL dialect and executed by Snowflake.

* Translation includes:
    * Converting SQL syntax, functions, and data types.
    * Mapping Postgres catalogs/schemas/tables/views to those in Delta Lake/Snowflake.
    * Handling supported Postgres features and failing gracefully on unsupported ones.

----

h4. C. Data Access

* There is NO direct read/write to Delta Lake files or Snowflake storage blocks using the Postgres storage engine.
* All data access is mediated by the native engine (Databricks or Snowflake) after the query is translated.
* You cannot connect with a raw Postgres client and use PostgreSQL-specific extensions or full transaction semantics as on Aurora or native Postgres.

----

h3. 3. Analogy

* Think of it as a language interpreter:
    * You speak Postgres; the interpreter restates your request in the “native tongue” of Databricks or Snowflake.
    * The answer is translated back to you in the Postgres protocol, so your client is none the wiser.

----

h3. 4. Implications of This Design

* Compatibility is high, but not perfect:
    * Simple queries, selects, inserts, updates, deletes—generally work as expected.
    * Some complex features, like custom extensions, procedural code (PL/pgSQL), certain transaction/locking semantics, or system catalogs—may not be supported or may behave differently.
* Performance and capabilities are determined by the underlying engine (Delta Lake or Snowflake), not by PostgreSQL itself.
* Schema management, data types, and functions: Only the subset that can be mapped and executed natively is available.
* Transactional semantics: You get whatever the base engine supports (Delta Lake’s ACID via log + Parquet, not full Postgres MVCC).

----

h3. 5. Why Do Vendors Do This?

* Universality: Leverage the vast ecosystem of Postgres tools/clients.
* Simplicity: Lower migration/integration friction; existing apps “just work” (mostly).
* Modernization: Expose data lake/warehouse data to operational or BI use cases without full data movement.

----

h3. 6. How Is This Different From Aurora Postgres?

* Aurora Postgres is real PostgreSQL—no translation or wire protocol emulation. It is the full Postgres codebase, just supercharged and cloud-managed.

----

h3. 7. Summary Table

|| Platform || Postgres Protocol || Query Engine Underneath || Data Store || Query Execution Path ||
| Databricks Lakebase | Yes (Emulated) | Databricks SQL / Delta | Delta Lake (Parquet) | Postgres SQL → Lakehouse SQL |
| Snowflake Postgres  | Yes (Emulated) | Snowflake SQL Engine   | Snowflake Storage    | Postgres SQL → Snowflake SQL |
| Aurora Postgres     | Yes (Native)   | Real PostgreSQL        | Aurora Storage       | Native Postgres Execution    |

----

h3. 8. Key Takeaway

* Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres give you “Postgres compatibility” by emulating the wire protocol and translating your SQL into their own engines—not by running real Postgres on their storage.
* This lets you use Postgres clients/tools but with the power and scalability of a lakehouse/warehouse backend.

What is a Wire Protocol?

A wire protocol is essentially the concrete, low-level specification of how data is formatted, encoded, and transmitted between systems over a network (“on the wire”). It’s the agreed-upon way that two or more systems serialize, send, and deserialize messages to achieve interoperability.
	•	Example: When a client queries a database over the network (say, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or even Apache Kafka), both client and server must agree on the byte-level format of requests and responses. That format is the “wire protocol.”

Is it a Standard?
	•	Not a universal standard: There is no single “wire protocol” that everyone uses. Instead, each system may define its own wire protocol.
	•	For example, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, and MySQL each have their own, often proprietary, wire protocols.
	•	Sometimes standardized: In other cases, wire protocols are based on open standards:
	•	HTTP is a standardized wire protocol for the web.
	•	gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its wire protocol and Protocol Buffers as the message format.
	•	Thrift, Avro RPC, REST/JSON, and SOAP/XML are other examples, each with a wire protocol aspect.

Why is it Important?
	•	It defines how applications communicate at the byte level.
	•	Ensures interoperability (or, in closed systems, enforces proprietary control).
	•	Impacts performance, extensibility, and sometimes security.

In Summary
	•	Wire protocol means the exact format and rules for data exchange between systems over a network.
	•	It is not a universal standard, but many protocols and technologies define their own or use widely adopted ones.
