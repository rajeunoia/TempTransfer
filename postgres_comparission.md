h2. Deep Dive: Databricks Lakebase vs. Snowflake Postgres vs. AWS Aurora Postgres as Low-Latency Data Stores

h3. 1. What Are These Postgres-Compatible Offerings?

* *Databricks Lakebase (Postgres-Compatible)*
** Announced at Data+AI Summit 2024, Databricks Lakehouse now supports a fully Postgres-compatible endpoint ("Lakebase") on top of its Delta Lake storage.
** Lets you query lakehouse data with the Postgres wire protocol and SQL syntax.
** Data remains in Delta Lake; Databricks provides a Postgres protocol server translating SQL to optimized lakehouse queries.
** Goal: Seamless integration for operational analytics; lower cost than maintaining OLTP DB.

* *Snowflake Postgres*
** PostgreSQL-compatible endpoint for Snowflake, announced in 2024.
** Provides Postgres wire protocol, enabling BI tools, legacy apps, and microservices to use Snowflake as if it's Postgres.
** Internally translates Postgres protocol queries to Snowflake SQL and executes on its columnar storage.

* *Aurora Postgres (AWS)*
** Cloud-native, fully managed, highly compatible Postgres database.
** Runs real Postgres code, with managed high availability, multi-AZ replication, and fast failover.
** Aurora separates compute/storage, up to 15 read replicas, supports cross-region/global deployments.
** Goal: Fully-featured OLTP and analytics platform for apps, reporting, and analytic workloads.

h3. 3. Suitability as a Low-Latency Consumption Layer

* *Databricks Lakebase*
** Strengths: Postgres endpoint for apps/BI, operational analytics, ML feature serving. Query pushdown, serverless scaling. Best for analytics, dashboards, not high-frequency OLTP.
** Caveats: Lower per-row throughput and higher latency for OLTP. ACID semantics match Delta Lake, not all Postgres nuances.

* *Snowflake Postgres*
** Strengths: Same as Lakebase – operational analytics, BI, app integration. Strong concurrency and fast dashboard/app access.
** Caveats: Not built for high-throughput single-row OLTP; optimal for analytics, dashboards, feature serving.

* *Aurora Postgres*
** Strengths: True OLTP performance, transactional, concurrent, low-latency row-level reads/writes. Great for microservices, mobile, dashboards. Massive read scaling, high write throughput (single writer).
** Caveats: Billed per usage, potentially expensive for massive, infrequent workloads. Data must be loaded into Aurora, not direct lake/warehouse access.

h2. Understanding the Postgres Wire Protocol and Emulator Approach in Databricks Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres

h3. 1. What Does "Postgres Wire Protocol" Mean?

* The Postgres wire protocol is the low-level, binary network protocol used by PostgreSQL clients (like psql, DBeaver, or BI tools) to communicate with a Postgres server.
* Supporting this protocol means any standard Postgres client can connect “as if” it’s talking to a real Postgres database.

----

h3. 2. What’s Really Happening in Databricks Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres?

* Both platforms provide a proxy server that speaks the Postgres wire protocol.
* When a client connects (Tableau, DBT, psycopg2, etc.), it believes it’s talking to a real Postgres backend.
* Under the hood, these are *not* running a full Postgres engine.

----

h4. A. Protocol Emulation Layer

* Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres offer a “proxy” that speaks the Postgres wire protocol.
* The client (BI tool, app, etc.) connects and sends SQL just like with a native Postgres DB.
* However, the backend is not Postgres—it’s a translation/emulation layer.

----

h4. B. Query Translation/Adaptation

* The Postgres-compatible endpoint parses incoming Postgres SQL and translates it into the native query language of the underlying platform:

**Databricks Lakebase:**
    * Postgres SQL → Delta Lake SQL / Databricks SQL
    * Queries are re-mapped for execution on Delta Lake tables and the Databricks engine.

**Snowflake Postgres:**
    * Postgres SQL → Snowflake SQL
    * Queries are rewritten to Snowflake’s internal SQL dialect and executed by Snowflake.

* Translation includes:
    * Converting SQL syntax, functions, and data types.
    * Mapping Postgres catalogs/schemas/tables/views to those in Delta Lake/Snowflake.
    * Handling supported Postgres features and failing gracefully on unsupported ones.

----

h4. C. Data Access

* There is NO direct read/write to Delta Lake files or Snowflake storage blocks using the Postgres storage engine.
* All data access is mediated by the native engine (Databricks or Snowflake) after the query is translated.
* You cannot connect with a raw Postgres client and use PostgreSQL-specific extensions or full transaction semantics as on Aurora or native Postgres.

----

h3. 3. Analogy

* Think of it as a language interpreter:
    * You speak Postgres; the interpreter restates your request in the “native tongue” of Databricks or Snowflake.
    * The answer is translated back to you in the Postgres protocol, so your client is none the wiser.

----

h3. 4. Implications of This Design

* Compatibility is high, but not perfect:
    * Simple queries, selects, inserts, updates, deletes—generally work as expected.
    * Some complex features, like custom extensions, procedural code (PL/pgSQL), certain transaction/locking semantics, or system catalogs—may not be supported or may behave differently.
* Performance and capabilities are determined by the underlying engine (Delta Lake or Snowflake), not by PostgreSQL itself.
* Schema management, data types, and functions: Only the subset that can be mapped and executed natively is available.
* Transactional semantics: You get whatever the base engine supports (Delta Lake’s ACID via log + Parquet, not full Postgres MVCC).

----

h3. 5. Why Do Vendors Do This?

* Universality: Leverage the vast ecosystem of Postgres tools/clients.
* Simplicity: Lower migration/integration friction; existing apps “just work” (mostly).
* Modernization: Expose data lake/warehouse data to operational or BI use cases without full data movement.

----

h3. 6. How Is This Different From Aurora Postgres?

* Aurora Postgres is real PostgreSQL—no translation or wire protocol emulation. It is the full Postgres codebase, just supercharged and cloud-managed.

----

h3. 7. Summary Table

|| Platform || Postgres Protocol || Query Engine Underneath || Data Store || Query Execution Path ||
| Databricks Lakebase | Yes (Emulated) | Databricks SQL / Delta | Delta Lake (Parquet) | Postgres SQL → Lakehouse SQL |
| Snowflake Postgres  | Yes (Emulated) | Snowflake SQL Engine   | Snowflake Storage    | Postgres SQL → Snowflake SQL |
| Aurora Postgres     | Yes (Native)   | Real PostgreSQL        | Aurora Storage       | Native Postgres Execution    |

----

h3. 8. Key Takeaway

* Lakebase and Snowflake Postgres give you “Postgres compatibility” by emulating the wire protocol and translating your SQL into their own engines—not by running real Postgres on their storage.
* This lets you use Postgres clients/tools but with the power and scalability of a lakehouse/warehouse backend.




h2. Databricks Lakebase: Postgres OLTP + Sync from Delta Lake

h3. 1. Lakebase as a Real Postgres OLTP Engine

* Lakebase is a fully managed Postgres OLTP database engine tightly integrated into the Databricks Lakehouse platform.  
* It supports low-latency (< 10 ms), high-concurrency OLTP transactions (>10 k QPS) via true Postgres protocol and semantics—not just an emulation layer.  
* Built upon open-source Postgres, Lakebase includes full ACID support, PostGIS, pgvector extensions, and standard Postgres features.  
* Compute and storage are decoupled; data is stored in Databricks-managed storage separate from compute, allowing independent scaling.

h3. 2. Synced Tables: Keeping Lakehouse & Lakebase in Sync

* You can define **synced tables**, which mirror Unity Catalog tables into a Lakebase (Postgres) instance.  
* Supported sync modes: *Snapshot*, *Triggered*, or *Continuous*.  
  * *Continuous* mode uses Databricks-managed Lakeflow pipelines to propagate changes in near real-time.  
* Sync pipelines use Change Data Feed (CDF) and can update tables continuously with ~<15s latency.  
* Synced tables are READ‑ONLY on the Postgres side; they can be indexed for fast lookups and queried by standard Postgres clients.

h3. 3. OLTP + Analytics Pattern

* *Writes* to Lakebase like inserts/updates/deletes go to the Postgres engine. A downstream Spark job can MERGE data into Delta Lake (e.g. SCD2 logic), preserving history.  
* *Reads* directly on synced tables deliver low-latency access from Postgres protocol—even while underlying lakehouse analytics run in Delta Lake.  
* Users can build real-time apps (e.g., dashboards, admin tools) on Postgres, while still querying historical data via Spark or SQL warehouses.

h3. 4. How It Compares to Protocol-Only Emulators

* Unlike Databricks Lakehouse’s previous Lakebase preview (wire‑protocol translator), current Lakebase provides a full Postgres database instance—*not just a proxy*.  
* Supports true transactional workloads, branching (copy-on-write clone), retention window, and high-concurrency queries.  
* `Synced tables` serve as a managed, fast materialized replica of lakehouse source tables, managed internally.

h3. 5. Summary Table

|| Capability                     || Lakebase (Current Preview) |
| Postgres wire protocol support | ✅ Full server instance      |
| True OLTP                      | ✅ Yes, ACID, indexes, joins |
| Sync from Delta Lake          | ✅ Snapshot/Triggered/Continuous Pend |
| Low-latency reads              | ✅ <10 ms on synced tables    |
| High concurrency               | ✅ >10k QPS                   |
| Writes backed by Spark ETL     | ✅ Supported via downstream jobs |

h3. 6. Key Takeaway

* Lakebase today isn’t just a translation wrapper—it’s a *real Postgres OLTP engine* with built-in support to sync and serve data from Databricks-managed Delta Lake via synced tables. This enables operational apps and BI clients to access low-latency, materialized data in Postgres while retaining the Delta Lake as analytical source of truth.

What is a Wire Protocol?

A wire protocol is essentially the concrete, low-level specification of how data is formatted, encoded, and transmitted between systems over a network (“on the wire”). It’s the agreed-upon way that two or more systems serialize, send, and deserialize messages to achieve interoperability.
	•	Example: When a client queries a database over the network (say, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or even Apache Kafka), both client and server must agree on the byte-level format of requests and responses. That format is the “wire protocol.”

Is it a Standard?
	•	Not a universal standard: There is no single “wire protocol” that everyone uses. Instead, each system may define its own wire protocol.
	•	For example, Kafka, Cassandra, MongoDB, and MySQL each have their own, often proprietary, wire protocols.
	•	Sometimes standardized: In other cases, wire protocols are based on open standards:
	•	HTTP is a standardized wire protocol for the web.
	•	gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its wire protocol and Protocol Buffers as the message format.
	•	Thrift, Avro RPC, REST/JSON, and SOAP/XML are other examples, each with a wire protocol aspect.

Why is it Important?
	•	It defines how applications communicate at the byte level.
	•	Ensures interoperability (or, in closed systems, enforces proprietary control).
	•	Impacts performance, extensibility, and sometimes security.

In Summary
	•	Wire protocol means the exact format and rules for data exchange between systems over a network.
	•	It is not a universal standard, but many protocols and technologies define their own or use widely adopted ones.
