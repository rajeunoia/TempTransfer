h1. Unified Data Control Plane – Executive Overview

h2. Vision

Create a *single, centralized control plane* that unifies governance, observability, orchestration, and access across diverse data platforms—without replacing native platform capabilities.

This layer enforces *policies once*, gathers cross‑platform telemetry, drives automation, and presents a consistent user experience.

---

h2. Scope

* *Data Lake*: AWS S3 with Glue Catalog & Lake Formation governance
* *Data Warehouse*: Snowflake with External Tables on S3 + Internal Catalog
* *Global Catalog*: Aggregates technical metadata and distribution information across all systems
* *Event Bus*: Normalizes data operation and activity events from all platforms

h2. Key Capabilities

# *FinOps & Cost Optimization*
** Unified cost tracking (storage, compute, egress) per domain/product/user
** Budgets, anomaly detection, optimization recommendations
** Historical trend analysis for cost forecasting
** Cross‑platform cost attribution to projects or business units

# *Unified Access Control & AuthZ*
** Policy‑as‑code → compile to Snowflake/IAM/Lake Formation
** JIT, time‑bound, and least‑privilege access
** Centralized identity mapping with SSO integration
** Access review workflows with periodic re‑certification

# *Monitoring & Observability*
** Health model for datasets; SLOs with error budgets
** Freshness, volume, and failure rate tracking
** Real‑time alerting via integration with Slack/Teams/Email
** Root cause enrichment using lineage context

# *Logging & Audit*
** Immutable logs of grants, changes, events, and access
** Evidence packs for audits
** Searchable audit history with filters by user, dataset, or time
** Tamper‑evident logging for compliance needs

# *Data Discovery*
** Cross‑platform catalog with taxonomy, sensitivity tags, SLAs, lineage
** Search + semantic tagging for easier findability
** Popularity ranking based on usage analytics
** Dataset trust score combining freshness, quality, and SLA adherence

# *Data Access Compliance Requests*
** Policy‑driven approvals with evidence trails
** Time‑boxed access & auto‑revocation
** Tiered approval workflows based on risk scoring
** Self‑service request portal with policy simulation

# *Integration Orchestration*
** Event‑driven workflows; trigger native jobs/tasks
** Coordinate dependencies across platforms
** Cross‑platform dependency graph visualization
** Retry, failover, and backoff strategies for job reliability

# *Cross‑Platform Lineage*
** End‑to‑end lineage for impact analysis & change propagation
** Lineage‑aware policy enforcement for PII
** Automatic lineage capture from ETL/ELT tools
** Query‑level lineage from Snowflake and S3 log parsing

# *Quality & Contract Enforcement*
** Schema compatibility checks, quality rules, promotion gates
** Automated regression tests for datasets
** Quality SLA monitoring with breach escalation
** Data drift detection using statistical profiling

# *User Experience Portal*
** Self‑service discovery, access, lineage, cost, health in one UI
** Persona‑based dashboards for producers, consumers, governance, and FinOps
** In‑portal guided workflows for dataset onboarding
** API & CLI parity for automation

# *Eventing on Data Operations*
** Capture, normalize, and route events from all platforms
** Drive automation and alerts from operations
** Pre‑defined event types (schema change, SLA breach, cost anomaly, PII detection)
** Event replay for back‑testing new automation rules

# *Unified API Gateway for Data Platforms*
** Acts as a single API layer that exposes all externally consumable APIs from S3, Glue, Lake Formation, Snowflake, and other connected systems
** Normalizes authentication, authorization, and request throttling across all platform APIs
** Provides API catalog & documentation for developers and external consumers
** Enables consistent API versioning and lifecycle management across data products
** Allows policy-driven exposure of APIs (e.g., restrict certain datasets or methods)
** Supports monitoring, metering, and monetization of API usage for FinOps integration

h2. Eventing Layer

*Sources*: AWS S3, Glue, Lake Formation, Snowflake, Global Catalog

*Event Types:*
* Schema changes
* Data quality breaches
* Access changes
* Cost anomalies
* Lifecycle state changes (archival, tiering)
* SLA breaches

*Actions:*
* Trigger workflows/playbooks
* Notify consumers/producers
* Auto‑remediate or revoke access

---

h2. Benefits
* *Consistent Governance*: Define once, enforce everywhere
* *Operational Efficiency*: Faster onboarding, reduced manual work
* *Trust & Transparency*: Clear lineage, SLAs, and quality signals
* *Cost Control*: Full spend visibility and optimization levers
* *Scalable Integration*: Extend via adapters for new platforms
