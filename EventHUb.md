Nice — here’s a compact, practical catalogue of event-integration patterns you’ll see in enterprise architectures, what each does, when to use it, pros/cons, and key implementation concerns. Treat this like a toolbox: pick 1–3 patterns per integration use-case (don’t try to apply everything everywhere).

1. Publish / Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

What: Producers publish events to topics; multiple independent consumers subscribe and process.
When to use: Fan-out notifications, analytics, decoupled microservices.
Pros: Loose coupling, easy fan-out, scalable.
Cons: Harder to guarantee ordering across subscribers; consumers must handle idempotency.
Key concerns: Partitioning/key selection for ordering, consumer groups, retention & replay, auth.

2. Event Sourcing

What: All state changes are persisted as an immutable stream of events; state is derived by replaying events.
When to use: Need full audit logs, rebuild state, complex business workflows.
Pros: Auditability, time-travel, can rebuild/read models.
Cons: Operational complexity, storage growth, versioning of events.
Key concerns: Snapshots, schema evolution, migration tools, read-model design.

3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) + Events

What: Commands update state (write model); events update/read models used for queries (read model updated asynchronously).
When to use: High read/write separation, complex read models, scalability.
Pros: Optimized read/write paths, flexible read-models.
Cons: Increased eventual consistency complexity.
Key concerns: Consistency windows, reconciliation, ordering of events.

4. Change Data Capture (CDC)

What: Database changes (inserts/updates/deletes) are captured and emitted as events (often via log-based capture).
When to use: Data sync between DBs, populate data lake, migrate legacy apps.
Pros: Low intrusion to source systems; reliable source-of-truth changes.
Cons: Schema drift, tombstone handling, ordering across tables.
Key concerns: Debezium-style tooling, primary key mapping, transactional boundaries, idempotency.

5. Outbox Pattern

What: Write business data and integration event to same DB transaction (outbox table); a separate process publishes outbox rows to the event bus.
When to use: Guarantee atomicity between DB write and event emission.
Pros: Avoids lost events; strong consistency at the transaction level.
Cons: Extra polling/worker plumbing; operational overhead.
Key concerns: Polling frequency, deduplication, idempotent consumers.

6. Request-Reply over Events (Correlation / Reply Topics)

What: A caller emits a request event with correlation id and listens for a reply event on a reply queue/topic.
When to use: Long-running async operations where the caller needs a response.
Pros: Asynchronous, scales better than synchronous RPC for long tasks.
Cons: More complex correlation, increased latency.
Key concerns: Timeouts, correlation IDs, reply-topic scaling, security of reply channels.

7. Saga (Choreography and Orchestration)

What: Long-running distributed transactions composed of multiple steps with compensation.
	•	Choreography: Services react to events to perform local actions.
	•	Orchestration: A central orchestrator directs each step.
When to use: Complex distributed workflows (order processing, payments).
Pros: Models distributed change with compensating actions.
Cons: Complexity in error handling and compensations.
Key concerns: State management, retries, idempotency, visibility, timeouts.

8. Message Routing / Content-Based Routing

What: Messages are routed to destinations based on content (headers, payload) or rules.
When to use: Flexible integration where the same event may go to different systems based on content.
Pros: Dynamic routing, fewer producers.
Cons: Routing rules can become complex; central rule management required.
Key concerns: Rule authoring UI, performance of evaluation, observability.

9. Event Mesh / Broker Federation (Global Event Fabric)

What: Network of brokers that route events across regions, clouds, or clusters.
When to use: Multi-region/multi-cloud enterprises needing low-latency local consumption and global distribution.
Pros: Localized latency, resilience across regions.
Cons: Complexity, message duplication, ordering across regions.
Key concerns: Duplicate suppression, conflict resolution, geo-replication strategy.

10. Store-and-Forward (Gateway / Edge Buffering)

What: Events are stored at the edge (gateway/device) and forwarded when connectivity is available.
When to use: Unreliable networks, IoT, remote offices.
Pros: Resilience to intermittent connectivity.
Cons: Potential duplicates, state reconciliation required.
Key concerns: Backpressure, local storage limits, security of cached events.

11. Brokerless (Direct) Integration / Webhooks

What: Systems call each other directly (HTTP/webhooks) instead of going through a central broker.
When to use: Low-volume integrations or when a single consumer needs immediate notification.
Pros: Simpler; minimal infra.
Cons: Tight coupling, brittle (consumer availability required), scaling issues.
Key concerns: Retry/backoff, security, validating consumer endpoints, delivery guarantees.

12. Bulk / Batch Event Transfer

What: Events are collected and sent in batches (files, bulk API) rather than single-record streams.
When to use: Cost-sensitive integrations, large-volume archival exports, when latency is not critical.
Pros: Efficient throughput and cost.
Cons: Higher latency, complexity in incremental batches.
Key concerns: Checkpointing, deduplication, atomicity of batch processing.

13. Materialized View / Event Carried State Transfer

What: Events carry the full or partial state so consumers can update materialized views (denormalized read stores).
When to use: Keep read-models in sync across systems without querying the primary store.
Pros: Fast local reads; decouples consumers from source DB.
Cons: Larger event payloads; schema evolution challenges.
Key concerns: Event size limits, versioning, snapshotting.

14. Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ) and Retry Patterns

What: Failed messages are retried with exponential backoff; after retries exceed threshold, moved to DLQ for human inspection.
When to use: Any resilient event processing system.
Pros: Prevents poison messages from blocking pipelines.
Cons: Requires operational processes to handle DLQ backlog.
Key concerns: Visibility into DLQ, automated remediation where safe.

15. Competing Consumers / Work Queue

What: Many consumers pull from a single queue; each message is processed once by any consumer.
When to use: Parallel processing of independent tasks (jobs, background processing).
Pros: Work parallelism, simple scaling.
Cons: Need to handle idempotency and ordering if required.
Key concerns: Consumer scaling, visibility timeouts, retry behavior.

16. Transformation & Enrichment (Stream Processing)

What: Events are enriched, filtered, aggregated, or transformed in-flight (stream processors).
When to use: Data normalization, enrichment with reference data, real-time analytics.
Pros: Keeps consumers simple; centralizes enrichment logic.
Cons: Processor becomes a critical dependency.
Key concerns: Stateful vs stateless transforms, checkpointing, latency.

17. Schema Registry + Contract Testing (Governed Events)

What: Central registry for event schemas + automated contract tests to prevent breaking changes.
When to use: Multi-team environments with many producers/consumers.
Pros: Safer evolution of schemas, fewer production breakages.
Cons: Governance overhead.
Key concerns: Backward/forward compatibility rules, CI integration.

Cross-cutting non-functional concerns to consider
	•	Delivery semantics: at-least-once (most common), at-most-once, or exactly-once (harder). Use dedup IDs if needed.
	•	Ordering: If ordering matters, pick partitioning strategy and consumers that preserve order.
	•	Idempotency: Consumers must be idempotent or use dedup stores.
	•	Observability: End-to-end tracing, per-topic metrics, consumer lag dashboards, DLQ monitoring.
	•	Security: AuthN/Z per topic, encryption in transit/at rest, token rotation, auditing.
	•	Governance: Naming conventions, domain ownership, lifecycle (deprecation), cost allocation.
	•	Testing: Contract testing, staging event hubs, local emulator for dev.
	•	Cost & Retention: Hot vs cold tiers, archival strategies to object storage for long retention.

Common anti-patterns (avoid these)
	•	Using pub/sub as a synchronous RPC replacement (leads to complexity).
	•	Tight coupling of event schemas across teams without a registry.
	•	Single monolithic consumer doing many unrelated things (violates separation of concerns).
	•	No DLQ or retry policy — poison messages stall pipelines.

Quick decision checklist (pick a pattern)
	1.	Do you need real-time? → prefer Pub/Sub, Stream Processing, CDC.
	2.	Do you need audit / replay? → Event Sourcing or retain events long.
	3.	Do you need transactional atomicity with DB writes? → Outbox.
	4.	Is this a long-running business workflow? → Saga (choreography/orchestration).
	5.	Is network unreliable or edge device involved? → Store-and-forward.
	6.	Do many teams own events? → Schema Registry + Governance + Event Mesh.

	1.	Event Production
	•	What: Producers (apps, devices, batch jobs) emit events.
	•	Responsibilities: choose event types, payload shape, source metadata, publish protocol (HTTP, Kafka client, AMQP), client retries/backoff.
	•	Key concerns: schema design, semantic naming (e.g., order.created), versioning, producer-side validation, security (auth + TLS).
	2.	Event Ingestion & Persistence
	•	What: The hub accepts events, validates, partitions, and persistently stores them for the configured retention window.
	•	Responsibilities: authentication/authorization, schema validation (via registry), partitioning key strategy, immediate durable writes (replication), throttling, deduplication.
	•	Key concerns: throughput, backpressure handling, partition hot-keys, retention policy, storage costs, write durability SLAs.
	3.	Event Processing or Routing
	•	What: Stream processors, filters, enrichers, and routers consume the persistent log to transform or route events to topics/streams or other sinks.
	•	Responsibilities: enrichment (lookup joins), filtering, protocol translation, business logic, routing/fan-out, windowing/aggregation, watermark handling.
	•	Key concerns: stateful vs stateless processing, exactly-once semantics (if needed), latency budget, scaling of processors.
	4.	Event Delivery or Consumption
	•	What: Final targets receive processed events — databases, microservices, data lake, workflows, downstream event buses.
	•	Responsibilities: reliable delivery (push or pull), ack/offset commit patterns, consumer-side idempotency, dead-lettering for poison messages.
	•	Key concerns: consumer lag, retry/backoff strategies, delivery guarantees, eventual consistency implications for downstream systems.
	5.	(Cross-cutting) Monitoring & Replay
	•	What: Observability, governance, and the ability to reprocess events end-to-end.
	•	Responsibilities: metrics (throughput, latency, lag), distributed tracing, logging, audit trails (who produced/consumed), alerts, DLQs, replay interfaces (offset/time-based), and provenance tracking.
	•	Key concerns: retention settings to enable replay, replay safety (idempotency, schema compatibility), cost/impact of replays.
